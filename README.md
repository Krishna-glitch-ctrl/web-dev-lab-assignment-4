JavaScript Quiz Game – Lab Assignment 4

This repository contains my Lab Assignment 4 for JavaScript.  
I created a simple quiz game that runs in the *browser console* using basic JavaScript concepts like arrays, loops, functions, and conditionals. The quiz asks questions through `prompt()` and gives feedback using `alert()`.


 Project Overview

The quiz contains 5 questions stored inside an array.  
For each question, the user enters an answer, gets instant feedback, and at the end, the program displays the final score.

This assignment helped me understand:
- Using arrays to store multiple questions
- Looping through each question with a `for` loop
- Using functions to organize the code
- Input handling using `prompt()`
- Cleaning input with `toLowerCase()` and `trim()`
- Conditional checking for correct/incorrect answers
- Score tracking



 How to Run the Quiz

1. Open *Google Chrome*
2. Press *F12* to open Developer Tools
3. Go to the *Console* tab
4. Open the `quiz.js` file and copy the entire code
5. Paste it into the console
6. Press *Enter* to start the quiz



What I Learned

- Arrays and objects for storing data  
- Loops for repeating tasks  
- Functions for organizing code  
- Using `prompt()` and `alert()`  
- Handling text input properly  
- Conditional logic (`if-else`)  
- Updating and displaying the quiz score
